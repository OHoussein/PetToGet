# PetToGet
![Workflow result](https://github.com/OHoussein/android-dev-challenge-compose/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
This is a pet adoption app, built with Jetpack Compose (no Android views anymore).


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
As part of the #AndroidDevChallenge, I made this application to discover jetpack compose in details and challenge myself with this new technology.
Quickly, I felt in love  with this technology. It's so easy to create ui and reuse components between the application. Also the declarative UI make a more stable app with less state synchronization bugs.
